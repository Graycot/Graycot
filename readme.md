# Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the web. 

I'm Gray, and this GitHub page is the home for my code! *(and a convenient offsite backup).*  Specifically, the /Graycot repository contains ideas and work that are not large enough to have their own repository. Here you will find various hobby projects, personal websites, and community building content.
