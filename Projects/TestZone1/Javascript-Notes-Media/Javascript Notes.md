## Notes

### 0. Prolouge

Link the javascript file right above the closing body tag. That way, your html and CSS load before the JS attempts to modify it.

```HTML
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <script src="/Projects/TestZone1/main.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Console

The developer console can be usually be opened in your browser of choice by right clicking empty space, clicking "Inspect", and clicking the tab labled "Console".

The Developer Console can be used as a text output. The console allows you to see warnings and errors generated by the browser. Additionally, you can run javascript directly from the console, though this is mainly used for debugging.

You can print out to the Developer Console using the methods listed below.

* log
* error
* warn

These are a few of the many methods that can be attatched to console object to output information to the Developer Console. Listed below are examples of log, error, and warn.

```Javascript
 console.log('Hello World!');
 console.error('This is an error!');
 console.warn('This is a warning!');
 ```

### Useful Snippits

``` Javascript
alert('Hello World!')
```

## Declarations

There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript. Declarations come before the name of a variable, and dictate the scope and assignablity of the variable.

1. var
   * (Global scope)
   * (Depreciated-ish)
2. let
   * (Block-level scope)
   * (Reassignable, can be changed later on)
3. const
   * (Block-level scope)
   * (Constant, cannot be changed once set)

[MDN DOCS: Declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements#declarations)

1. **var is the original JavaScript declaration.** Since ECMAScript 6, when Let and Const were added, it has become somewhat obsolete. It is generally considered bad practice to use var unless you have a specific reason for doing so.

2. **let is a general purpose declaration.** You can initialize it without a value

``` Javascript
let score;
```

and later assign a value

``` Javascript
score = 22;
```

or initialize it with a value

``` Javascript
let score = 22;
```

3. **const is a read-only variable that cannot be changed by reassignment.** const must be assigned a value at initialization

   :white_check_mark: **Valid Initialization:**
  
    ``` Javascript
    const age = 27;.
    ```

   :x:**Invalid Initialization:**

    ``` Javascript
    const age;
    ```

    * Note: *If a const is an object or an array, its properties and items can be modified, but the entire object or array can not be redeclared / reassigned*.

## Primative Data Types

Primative data types are data directly assigned to memory. It is not a resource.

**These are the five most important Primative data types in JavaScript:**

1. Strings
2. Numbers
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined

  *Other data types*

6. BigInt
7. Symbol

[MDN DOCS: JavaScript Types # Primative values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#javascript_types)

  There are a few important things to note about variables in JavaScript that are different from other programming languages.

* JavaScript is a **loosely typed and dynamic language**. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:
* I.E. When declaring a variable, it is not neccessary to specify the type of variable (String, Number, Boolean, ect). Javascript will automatically determine the variable type.
  * *Note: strings require single or double quotes before and after the variable content.*
  * If you wish to specify the variable type, you should use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a flavor of JavaScript that exists for this purpose.
  
* Almost all numbers (not contained in a string) will normally fall under the "number" variable type. This is different from other programming languages such as C++, where multiple number types such as "Float", "Double", & "Int" exist.

1. Strings

   ``` Javascript
   const name = 'John';
   ```

2. Numbers

     ``` Javascript
    const age = 27;

    const GPA = 3.5;
    ```

3. Boolean

   ``` Javascript
   const isNameJohn = true;
   ```

4. Null

    ``` Javascript
    const x = null;
    ```

5. Undefined

    ``` Javascript
    const y = undefined;
      
    let z;   (Initializing a variable without setting a value)
    ```

***

## Combining Console.log and Variables

```JavaScript
const name = 'John';
const age = 27;
const GPA = 3.5;
const isNameJohn = true;
const x = null;
const y = undefined;
let z;

console.log(name);
console.log(age);
console.log(GPA);
console.log(isNameJohn);
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(z);
```

*Output:*

You can find the data type of a variable by using the `typeof` method.

```Javascript
const name = 'John';
console.log(typeof name);
```

*Output:*

## Concatenation and Template Strings

Concatenation & Template Strings are tools used to connect multiple datum into a single string.

Concatenation:

```Javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 27;

console.log('Hello! My name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' years old.');
```

**NOTE: The phrase is required to be surrounded in Quotation marks.  ` ' ' ` or ` " " `**

![Developer Console Example 2-2](/Projects/TestZone1/Javascript-Notes-Media/DevConsole2-2.PNG =400x)

Template Strings:

```Javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 27;

console.log(`Hello! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
```

**NOTE: The phrase is required to be surrounded in Back Ticks.  `` ` ` ``.**

### Another Example

```JavaScript
const name = 'John';
const age = 27;

const hello = `Hello! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(hello);
```

## String Properties and Methods

Properties do not have a () on the tail end, while Methods() do have a () on the tail end.

* A property is intrinsic to the object.
* A method is a function associated with an object.

Properties:

* length tells you how many characters the string contains.

```JavaScript
  const x = 'Hello World';
  console.log(x.length);

  const y = 'Yee haw, Howdy World';
  console.log(y.length);
```

Methods:

* toUpperCase()
* toLowerCase()
* substring(X , Y) (Splits a string between the provided indices of X and Y)

```JavaScript
  const x = 'Hello World';
  console.log(x.toUpperCase());
  console.log(x.toLowerCase());
  console.log(x.substring(0, 5));
```

![Developer Console Example 2-4](/Projects/TestZone1/Javascript-Notes-Media/DevConsole2-4.PNG =150x)

Methods and properties can be tacked onto each other in a chain.
```JavaScript
  const x = 'Hello World';
  console.log(x.substring(0, 5).toUpperCase());
```

## Object Data Type

An object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.

In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.

Essentially, Objects are collections that point to other objects and Primative data types.

1. Object literals
2. Arrays
